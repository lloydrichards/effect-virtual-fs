Bound server shutdown when a compound stalls in the backing store.

`compound` ran its whole body inside `Effect.uninterruptible`. The read loop that calls it is forked into the server scope, so closing that scope interrupts the loop and awaits it — and an interrupt cannot enter an uninterruptible region. A VFS operation that never settled, such as a `READ` against a stalled backing store, held scope closure open indefinitely.

The blanket region is now a mask, and each operation in the compound is dispatched through `restore`. The sweep, the compound parse, the replay-cache hit path, and the replay-slot commit stay uninterruptible, so a compound can be abandoned between operations but never torn in half. An interrupt restores the slot's sequence ID, cached reply, and retained byte accounting, so the client's retry is accepted as a first attempt rather than refused as misordered or as a false retry.

The boundary this sets is between operations: an operation that mutates server state guards itself, as `OPEN` and `CLOSE` already did.
