Volumes now bound work waiting for admission and retain a finite number of events per watch subscriber. An excess operation fails with retryable `VolumeBusy` before it changes the volume. A subscriber that loses events receives a `Rescan` change and must rescan; it can continue using the same core watch. Configure the limits with `maxPendingOperations` and `maxWatchEvents`.

The memory `FileSystem.watch` stream ends on overflow with a platform error identified by `MemoryFileSystem.isWatchOverflow`. Open a new memory watch before rescanning its path. NFS maps `VolumeBusy` to `NFS4ERR_DELAY`; its public export remains read-only.
