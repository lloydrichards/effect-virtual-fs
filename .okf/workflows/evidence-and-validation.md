# Evidence and validation

Claims should be no broader than the check that supports them. A passing type consumer proves selected API composition, not filesystem behavior. A browser-target bundle proves bundling, not browser runtime operation. A focused regression proves its observable case, not complete standards conformance.

For a behavior change, identify the requirement or accepted decision, add a focused regression when appropriate, prove that the regression fails for the intended defect, repair narrowly, then run the relevant package and repository checks. Preserve structured errors and rejected-state invariants; do not validate behavior by parsing incidental error prose.

Workspace declarations must exist before Effect-aware lint analyzes package consumers. The repository CI sequence is frozen install, format check, build, ordinary lint, Effect-aware lint, documentation contract checks, type check, and tests. Tests and type checks also depend on upstream package builds through Turbo.

Retain evidence only when its conclusion still changes present design, use, testing, or maintenance. Suitable retained evidence includes a reproducible regression probe, a measurement supporting an active limit, or an interoperability trace supporting a capability claim. Do not retain routine green logs, historical test counts, local timings, milestone chronology, or environment snapshots merely as history; Git already preserves those.

Record current caveats beside the claim they constrain. The [current validation ledger](/evidence/current-validation.md "summarized by") captures only cross-cutting conclusions that remain relevant.
